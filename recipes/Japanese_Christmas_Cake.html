<h2>Note!!</h2>
<p>This traditional Japanese Christmas cake recipe is a favorite of cookbook author, recipe developer, and Allrecipes Allstar Lisa Childs,<br>
     who makes it every year for the holidays. It’s a super-light, delicious sponge cake layered with fresh whipped cream and strawberries.</p>
     <h3>Ingredients</h3>
     <ul>
         <li>6 large eggs, separated and at room temperature</li>
         <li>22 tablespoons white sugar, divided</li>
         <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
         <li>1 1/2 cups cake flour, sifted</li>
         <li>2 tablespoons avocado or grapeseed oil</li>
         <li>2 tablespoons whole milk</li>
         <li>1/2 cup water</li>
         <li>3 tablespoons orange liqueur, such as Grand Marnier®</li>
         <li>3 cups whipping cream</li>
         <li>1/2 to 3/4 cup powdered sugar</li>
         <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
         <li>1 pound fresh strawberries, sliced (3 cups)</li>
     </ul>

     <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> <br>Preheat oven to 320 degrees F (160 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8-inch cake pan; line with parchment paper. Parchment should extend 1 to 2 inches above the edge of the pan.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> <br>Mix egg yolks and 10 tablespoons white sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer on high until the mixture is pale and thick, 2 to 3 minutes. Wash and dry beaters.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> <br>Mix egg whites and 6 tablespoons white sugar in a medium bowl with an electric mixer on high until medium-stiff peaks form (tips curl). Mixture should be glossy and extremely fluffy.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Step 4:</strong><br> Gently fold about one-third of egg white mixture into egg yolk mixture. Add the remaining two-thirds egg white mixture; gently fold in, taking care not to deflate the batter, until fully incorporated, about 30 folds.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Step 5:</strong> <br>Stir together salt and flour in a medium bowl. Sift half of the flour mixture into batter; fold until just combined. Add remaining flour mixture; fold until well combined, about 40 folds.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Step 6:</strong><br> Stir together oil and milk in a small bowl; microwave on High about 30 seconds. Pour into batter; fold until well combined, about 30 folds. Batter should still be airy.</li>

        <li><strong>Step 7:</strong> <br>Pour batter into prepared pan. Gently tap pan on countertop to remove any air bubbles.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Step 8:</strong> <br>Bake in the preheated oven until the top is golden brown and an instant-read thermometer inserted in the center registers at least 190 degrees F (88 degrees C), 40 to 45 minutes. Invert onto a wire rack; let cool.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Step 9:</strong><br> Meanwhile, for simple syrup, combine hot water, liqueur, and remaining 6 tablespoons white sugar in a small bowl, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Let cool.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Step 10:</strong> <br>Pulse whipping cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla in a food processor until stiff peaks form, 45 seconds.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Step 11:</strong><br> To assemble cake, slice cooled cake horizontally into 3 equal (1-inch) layers. Brush simple syrup evenly over each portion, using all of it. Put one cake portion on a cake plate or serving tray.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Step 12:</strong><br> Spread about 3/4 cup whipped cream on plated cake layer. Arrange 1/3 of strawberries over cream. Spread another 3/4 cup whipped cream over strawberries, pressing whipped cream between berries. Top with a second cake layer; repeat with whipped cream, berries, and third cake layer.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Step 13:</strong> <br>Frost the top of the cake (and sides, if desired) with whipped cream. Garnish with the remaining 1/3 of strawberries.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Step 14:</strong> <br>Chill the cake at least 1 to 2 hours and up to 4 hours before serving to allow flavors to meld. Cut into 10 slices.</li>
    </ol>
